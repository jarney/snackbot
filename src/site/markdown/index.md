# SnackBot

Welcome to SnackBot, the Significantly Nifty Autonomous Computer Kontrolled
Bringer Of Treats.

The project intends to create an autonomous robot navigation system with voice
control and the capability to bring snacks.  The project is in the early stages.

The core systems are written in Java.  The core robot runs on a Raspberry PI,
is controlled through a RoboClaw motor controller, and uses two webcams 
for stereoscopic sight and navigation.
