# Construction : Base Assembly

The base assembly contains the battery, motors, and the electronic components.
This is the most crucial component because it forms the basis of the robot itself.
The other components, the waist, and the head are largely decorative elements.

# Detail: Base Side panels

This drawing shows the side panels for the base.  The triangular cutouts are for
wheel-access and the holes in the panels allow for screws which affix the base
lid to the base, providing a rigid surface for the waist to connect to,
while allowing access to the battery and motor compartments.
