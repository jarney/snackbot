# Detail: Waist Assembly

This drawing shows the waist assembly.  Its main purpose is to look kind-of
bad-ass.  The functional aspects of this assembly are marginal at best.

# Detail : Waist front panels

The front panel contains a hole which can be used as a viewport and access panel
to the inside of the robot.  It is largely decorative in nature.

# Detail : Waist Acrylic

This drawing is of the acrylic panel which fits into the front panel
and provides a way to see inside the internals of the robot.  Its primary
purpose is to be the "ooh, look, a robot!" aspect of the robot.

# Detail : Waist Sides

This drawing is of the waist side-panels.  It provides a kind-of futuristic
side-panel vent which is typical in lots of science-fiction robots, but
provides no useful purpose.
