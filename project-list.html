        <h1>Projects</h1><p>The snackbot project has been divided into a number of smaller sub-projects each of which identifies a particular problem to solve. The projects vary in difficulty, however, each of the projects can be a very interesting engineering exercise in its own right depending on how far you want to take it.</p><p>Each project has simple one-page summary sketch describing the inputs, the outputs, and in some cases a hint as to how to proceed. Very little detail is given so that the person working on that component can maximize their creativity in solving the problem.</p><div class="section"><h2><a href="project-find-a-path.html">Find A Path</a><a name="Find_A_Path"></a></h2><p>This project involves finding a path from a starting location to a goal location. It assumes that the starting location, ending location, and map of the world are available (each of those is its own project).</p></div><div class="section"><h2><a href="project-smooth-running.html">Smooth Running : Done</a><a name="Smooth_Running_:_Done"></a></h2><p>This project assumes that a list of waypoints has been found which correspond to the shortest path to the goal. In order to get from a to b smoothly, however, we would like to avoid sharp corners and abrupt starts and stops. This project involves taking a list of points and finding a smooth path between them. A cubic spline between the points is a good example of a technique that would work well here.</p></div><div class="section"><h2><a href="project-follow-the-path.html">Follow The Path</a><a name="Follow_The_Path"></a></h2><p>This project involves taking a smooth parameterized curve (like a cubic spline) and issuing commands to the robot drive system to follow the path. Periodic position updates will also come in telling us how far we have deviated from the desired path. We must smoothly correct for those deviations and maintain the path as accurately as we can.</p></div><div class="section"><h2><a href="project-see-the-world.html">See The World</a><a name="See_The_World"></a></h2><p>This project involves receiving input from an XBot Kinect sensor or other sensing device to deduce the map of the world.</p></div><div class="section"><h2><a href="project-hear-me.html">Hear Me</a><a name="Hear_Me"></a></h2><p>This project involves receiving voice commands given by the robot user and turning them into events which can be sent over the robots event bus as commands.</p></div><div class="section"><h2><a href="project-tank-drive.html">Tank Drive</a><a name="Tank_Drive"></a></h2><p>This project involves receiving commands in the form of speed and direction from the path following system. These must be turned into commands to the left and right motors which will cause the robot to follow that command. This is done by issuing commands to the IMotorWithEncoder interface for the left and right motors.</p><p>In addition, this command must give periodic outputs back to the path following system which indicate estimates of how far the robot has deviated from the desired commands. This is done by reading the encoder outputs from the motors and translating it back into actual distance and angle traveled.</p></div><div class="section"><h2><a href="project-where-am-i.html">Where Am I?</a><a name="Where_Am_I"></a></h2><p>This project involves looking at features in the robots environment and correlating them with features seen in the environment previously. Once the features have been correlated, the position of the robot relative to those features can be identified and a refined estimate of the robots actual position can be given.</p></div>
